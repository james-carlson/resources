### Code Environments
https://repl.it (Online REPL, compiler, and IDE)  
http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html (Includes languages other than Python, including JavaScript. Allows you to visualize code execution and see the control flow.)

### Computer Science
[Crash Course: Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) - A PBS-produced Youtube series of ~12 minute videos, covering a range of computer science topics. *Not* a coding video series--rather, provides history and context and some background knowledge for people without CS degrees.  
[Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) - "The OSSU curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials. It's not merely for career training or professional development. It's for those who want a proper, well-rounded grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own, but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners."

#### Less Common Commands
##### Change URL of remote 
<pre>git remote set url <em>https://url-of-repo</em></pre>
##### When git opens Vim and asks for a commit message (and you want to exit)
`:q!`  
The `:` tells Vim to enter command mode, the `q` tells Vim to quit, and the `!` means you really mean it.
##### Git in Groups

### Pay to learn
Resources that cost money (but may sometimes make content available for free). Sometimes paid courses are significantly higher quality than what's available for free. (Sometimes not.)  
* https://egghead.io/
* https://www.pluralsight.com/ - $30/month for individual, although there is a free course each week (haven't verified this personally: https://learn.pluralsight.com/resource/free-course/free-weekly-course)

#### Development Environment
##### Find what process is running the dev server at a specific port:
If the dev server is running on port 3000:
```
lsof -i :3000
```
This will produce some information like this: 
```
COMMAND    PID         USER   FD   TYPE  SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
Google    7257 jamescarlson   93u  IPv4       0t0  TCP localhost:55054->localhost:hbci (ESTABLISHED)
node      9614 jamescarlson   14u  IPv4       0t0  TCP *:hbci (LISTEN)
node      9614 jamescarlson   31u  IPv4       0t0  TCP localhost:hbci->localhost:55054 (ESTABLISHED)
```
Find the process ID in the PID column for COMMAND of "node". To kill that process, type `kill -9` and then the PID (in the example above, `9614`). 

<pre>
kill -9 <i>PID</i>
</pre>
